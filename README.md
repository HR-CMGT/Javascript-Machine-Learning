## Building something

Some tools and tutorials to quickly set up a Machine Learning demo

#### Practicing with Javascript

The [webcam detectotron](https://kokodoko.github.io/webcam-detectotron/) is a small javascript demo, that demonstrates the use of the 'k-nearest-neighbour' algorithm. This works entirely in the browser. You can [clone the source code](https://github.com/KokoDoko/webcam-detectotron) and get it running in 5 minutes. The readme file explains how you can build your own detectotron!

#### Machine Learning for Artists

Wekinator is a GUI for applying classification and regression algorithms to any input. Wekinator can connect to output from Processing, a webcam, an Arduino, by listening to OSC signals.
