# Javascript

Javascript allows us to publish our projects online, and provides easy ways to visualise our results using html and css.

## Brain JS

[BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) is a library that allows you to instantiate a Neural Network, train it and run a classification in just a few lines of code.

- [Source code and examples for BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js)

- [Advanced Image feature detection using BrainJS](https://scrimba.com/c/c36zkcb)

## Tensorflow JS

The Javascript version of Google TensorFlow. TensorflowJS has lots of tutorials, and add-on libraries that make working with it even easier.

- [Tutorial course for Webcam recognition](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-teachablemachine-codelab/index.html)

### ML5

ML5 makes TensorFlowJS more accessible by supplying readymade examples with clear documentation for the most common Machine Learning projects, such as image classification, pose recogition, and text generation.

- [Simplify working with TensorflowJS using the ML5 library](https://ml5js.org)

### Magenta JS

- [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/get-started/#magenta-js) is a google library that uses tensorflow to generate [images](https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js/image/index.html), [music](https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js/music/index.html) and [sketches](https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js/sketch/). 
- [Tutorial on drawing snowflakes with a Neural Network and Magenta](https://youtu.be/pdaNttb7Mr8)

## Perceptron

A perceptron is a Neural Network that has only one cell. You can code it by hand in just a few lines of code. This will help you to understand how one Neural Network cell calculates weights.

- [Coding a perceptron in Javascript, by Mathias P Johansson](https://youtu.be/o98qlvrcqiU), and the [result](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mpj/neural-network-from-scratch-part-1)

## Synaptic JS

Synaptic is another Neural Network Library for Javascript

- [Tutorial for Synaptic JS](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-create-a-neural-network-in-javascript-in-only-30-lines-of-code-343dafc50d49)

# Python

[Python](https://www.python.org) is used by data scientists and in many Machine Learning courses online. Python requires a bit more setup, especially when you want to visualise results graphically. Python can run on a Raspberry Pi!

- [Udacity Intro to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120)
