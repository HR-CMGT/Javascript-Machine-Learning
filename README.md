# <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction

Traditionally, developers write *sets of instructions*, also known as a *computer program*, to solve complex problems. This traditional approach has its limitations, especially when we want the computer to solve human tasks, such as recognising a drawing, or talking on the phone.

By using a Machine Learning algorithm, the computer can learn to recognise patterns in complex data all by itself. A machine learning algorithm can reveal patterns that would otherwise not have been found. The computer can learn to make decisions and to improve itself.

*A model can compare new drawings to cats, and it can even imagine new cat drawings*

## Algorithms

Algorithms are used to find patterns in complex data. Surprisingly, the algorithm itself does not have to be all that complex. You can start a machine learning project just by using the good old Pythagorean theorem:

![pythagorean](./images/pythagorean.png)

#### Our first Machine Learning algorithm: *a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>=c<sup>2</sup>*

By looking at your data and defining the goal of your project, you will have to decide on an algorithm that suits your purposes the best.

Simpler algorithms work faster, and allow for more introspection. As a developer you will have a lot of control on its output. 

Neural networks can analyse very complex data, and can learn from itself. A neural net may take a lot of time to train, and will create a sort of "black box", making it less transparent to understand how it makes decisions.

## Workshop

In the [Workshop](./workshop/introduction.md) you will learn the basics of using existing libraries and preparing data to train a neural network.  

Below you will find links to popular libraries with tutorials, existing kits, books and demo projects.

# <a name="javascript"></a>Javascript

Javascript allows us to publish our projects online, and provides easy ways to visualise our results using html and css.

### Brain JS

[BrainJS](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) is a library that allows you to instantiate a Neural Network, train it and run a classification in just a few lines of code.

### Tensorflow JS

The Javascript version of Google TensorFlow. TensorflowJS has lots of tutorials, and add-on libraries that make working with it even easier.

- [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org) ðŸ˜±

### ML5

ML5 makes TensorFlowJS more accessible by supplying readymade examples with clear documentation for the most common Machine Learning projects, such as image classification, pose recogition, and text generation.

### Magenta JS

- [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/get-started/#magenta-js) is a google library that uses tensorflow to generate [images](https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js/image/index.html), [music](https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js/music/index.html) and [sketches](https://tensorflow.github.io/magenta-js/sketch/).

### Perceptron

A perceptron is a Neural Network that has only one cell. You can code it by hand in just a few lines of code. This will help you to understand how one Neural Network cell calculates weights.

# <a name="python"></a>Python

[Python](https://www.python.org) is used by data scientists and in many Machine Learning courses online. Python requires a bit more setup, especially when you want to visualise results graphically. Python can run on a Raspberry Pi!
