# <a name="python"></a>Python

[Python](https://www.python.org) is used by data scientists and in many Machine Learning courses online. Python requires a bit more setup, especially when you want to visualise results graphically. 

[You can program without installing in Google's Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), and then you can even use Google's GPU for heavy neural network calculations.

[ðŸ¤¯ You can locally install Python and run Jupyter notebooks inside Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial)

Python can run on a Raspberry Pi and on several Adafruit Microcontrollers. You can use TensorFlow LITE on microcontrollers.
