# <a name="python"></a>Python

[Python](https://www.python.org) is used by data scientists and in many Machine Learning courses online. Many algorithms and libraries are available in Python that may not always be available in Javascript. The big disadvantage of Python is that the code runs only in your own environment. You can still use Python to train a model, which you can then load in a Javascript frontend. Also, you can run a Python app "live" on a raspberry Pi.

You can set up Python locally, but it's far easier to run a Jupyter Notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true), which also uses Google's GPU for heavy calculations.

[ðŸ¤¯ Jupyter notebooks can also run inside Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial)

Python can run on a Raspberry Pi and on several Adafruit Microcontrollers. You can even use TensorFlow LITE on microcontrollers.
